# Copy Page as Markdown Extension

This browser extension allows you to quickly copy the content of the current web page to your clipboard as Markdown.

## How to Use

1. Click the extension icon in your browser's toolbar.
2. In the small popup window that appears, click the "Copy as Markdown" button.
3. The content of the current tab will be converted to Markdown and copied to your clipboard.

### "Try to find main content only" Toggle

The extension includes a toggle labeled "Try to find main content only". When enabled, the extension will attempt to identify and copy only the primary content block of the page (looking for `<main>`, `#main`, or `.main` elements) instead of the entire page body.
